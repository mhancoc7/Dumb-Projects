I was sad to hear that the project is going into &quot;hibernation&quot;.</p>\n<h2><em>From <a href=\"https://seti.org\">seti.org</a>:</em></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>UC Berkeley has announced that the volunteer computing part of SETI@home will stop distributing work and go into hibernation on March 31. Two reasons were cited for this action:</p>\n<p>1) Scientifically, they have reached point of diminishing returns; basically, they analyzed all the data they need for now.</p>\n<p>2) Managing the distributed processing of data is labor intensive. The priority now is to focus on completing the back-end analysis of the results they already have, and writing this up in a scientific journal paper.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s important to note that SETI@home is not disappearing. The web site and message boards will continue to operate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://seti.org/setihome-going-hibernation\">Read more...</a></em></p>\n<p>Pi Lab has had a <a href=\"pi-lab-seti-home-node\">SETI@home Node</a> running since I started this project. I have decided to keep <a href=\"https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/\">SETI@home</a> installed and available in case the project comes back online. </p>\n<p>I have also updated the <a href=\"pi-lab-seti-home-node\">SETI@home Node</a> to the BOINC Node so that the node is more obviously dedicated to <a href=\"https://boinc.berkeley.edu/\">BOINC</a> projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I have updated the BOINC Node to run <a href=\"https://boinc.bakerlab.org/\">Rosetta@home</a> to help with COVID-19 research.
